### ***Description:***

This will be the repository where I upload my finished & unfinished coding exercises from <exercism.org>.

For anyone unfamiliar, Exercism is a site where coders of any experience level can learn, practice, and mentor/be mentored on their language(s). I definitely recommend it to anyone, especially those like me who are past the stage of wanting their hand held, but not necessarily 'proficient' enough to not need to review a lot.

The projects you find here will for the most part come with accompanying unit tests that must be passed before the exercise can be submitted to exercism.org. This is part of the value of Exercism, you are given a blank slate and a rough picture of what the end product should be, which then you can really narrow down through TDD. There should also be a readme and help .md file for each project, that give you a general idea of what you're trying to build and the best way to build it. That being said you aren't limited by these, as long as the tests are passed you're good. 

The actual exercises to modify and submit are under src/main/java.

The unit tests can be found under under src/main/test.
