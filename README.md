### ***Description:***

This will be the repository where I upload my finished & unfinished coding exercises from <exercism.org>.

For anyone unfamiliar, Exercism is a site where coders of any experience level can learn, practice, and mentor/be mentored on their language(s). I definitely recommend it to anyone, especially those like me who are past the stage of wanting their hand held, but not necessarily 'proficient' enough to not need to review a lot.
